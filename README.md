# Machine Learning Practice
Machine Learning Algrorithm realization.

We use spyder to create project, tend to  write some machine learning algorithm codes, which refer to 《Machine Learning in Action》.We will update the codes every week and regard it as a weekly task to finish.The project will cover supervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithm, also will contain other hard algorithms in the future.

I will also update some theoretical article in my csdn blog:[Reder's Blog](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_35719435)

Let us become better!!!

## linear_model

1. Linear Regression
2. Lasso Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. Logistic Regression
5. Locally Weighted Linear Regression
6. Nonnegative Lasso

## neighbors

1. k-nearest-neighbors

## tree

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. CART & Model Tree

## cluster

1. kmeans
2. binary kmeans

## ensemble

1. Adaboost
2. Random Forest
3. GBDT

## decomposition

1. PCA

Then we can define some metrics to measure the score of model.

## metrics

1. roc_curve
